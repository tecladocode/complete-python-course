Each comparison operator returns True or False
### Equal `==`

```python
4 == 4  # True
4 == 5 # False
```

- Can be used to check the truth value of an operand:

```python
4 is True  #  True
4 is False  # False
0 is False  # True
```

- Can be used to compare two strings or any other data type:

```python
"Hello" == "Hello"  # True
"Hello" == "HELLO"  # False
(100, 50) == 50  # False
(100, 50) == (500, 219)  # False
```

### Not equal `!=`
- The opposite of `==`

```python
4 != 4  # False
4 != 5  # True
```

### Greater than `>`
`10 > 10  # False`

### Less than `<`
- Opposite of higher than
`10 < 10  # False`

### Greater than or equal to `>=`
`10 >= 10  # True`

### Less than or equal to `<=`
`10 <= 10  # True`
