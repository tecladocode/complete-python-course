### Variables
- A variable is a name associated with a value.
- A variable can be named anything, but it has some rules:
    1. It cannot start with an integer
    2. It cannot contain spaces
    3. It can only contain a symbol, which is the underscore

Examples of variable names:

- Correct:

```
response
top500
one_apple
first_numbers
_usernames
_last_
current_
```


- Incorrect:

```
top 500
one apple
1st_numbers
^last_
$current
response#
```

### Strings
A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotation marks:
Single quotes `''` or Double quotes `""`


- Anything surrounded by the quotation marks indicate a string
- Every opening quote must have a closing quote to form a string
- If opening a string with a single quote, the closing quote must be a single quote as well

Examples:

- Correct:

```python
"This is a sample string using double quotes"
'This is a sample string using single quotes'
'This is a normal string'
'50 + 51'
```

- Incorrect:

```python
'This string will end here.' From here the continuation is not a string'
'This is an Incorrect string"
"Same as this one'
```

### Integers
An integer is a whole number of any length that can be positive or negative, written without a fractional element.

Example:

`-1` `0` `1` `2` `3` `86400`


### Floats
A float is a number that can be positive or negative written with a fractional element.

Example:

`-100.54` `1.0` `59.1` `10.99`

### Booleans
In Python booleans are a bool data type having two values:

```python
True
False
```

### Lists

- A list is an ordered sequential data type
- A list is used to store multiple elements in one place
- A list is created by a pair of square brackets

```python
shopping_list = ['cereals', 'milk', 'cherries']
midterm_grades = [4, 9, 6, 6]
```

- A list can contain different data types

`phone_numbers = ['james', 8067366796]`

- Each element in a list holds a position (index) through which it can be accessed

```python
shopping_list[0]  # cereals
shopping_list[1]  # milk
shopping_list[2]  # cherries
```

### Tuples
- A tuple is very much like a list, however:
  - A tuple is an ordered sequential data type which is **immutable**
- A tuple is created by a sequence of elements separated by a comma
- For better readability, it can be surrounded by parenthesis

Example:

```python
shopping_list = 'apples', 'milk', 'cherries'
midterm_grades = 4, 9, 6, 6
phone_numbers = 'james', 8067366796
better_readability = ('with', 'parenthesis')
```

### Sets
- A set is an **unordered** data type
- Elements of a set cannot be accessed by their indices
- A set is created by a single pair of curly brackets:

`shopping_list = {'apples', 'milk', 'cherries'}`

### Dictionaries
- A dictionary is created by 3 key components:
curly braces, keys and values
- The keys must be a string
- The values can be any other data type

Example:

```python
employees = {'ID': 16915, 'name': 'James', 'department': ['Sales', 'Accounting']}
```

```python
employees = {
  'ID': 16915,
  'name': 'James',
  'department': ['Sales', 'Accounting']
}
```

- A dictionary is accessed by keys as such:
`employees['name']  # 'James'`
